            <p>Football has been a passion of mine since I was very young, and it's a sport that's been with me since birth. In fact, I grew up in a family of footballers: from my father, who was a goalkeeper, to my uncle, who played semi-professional football, not forgetting my cousins and grandfather. So football was at the centre of discussions and priorities. I started playing football at the age of 5 in the small village where my father played at the time: Hindisheim. I soon joined the nearest 'town' club, Erstein. I've been with the club for 10 years now, playing in all the youth sections right up to the senior teams in which I currently play. A historic club, the best club in the east (in my humble opinion as a supporter), I quickly became a fan of this club, capable of the best and the worst. I've experienced great joys during great matches, but also great disappointments (like this season with an average team that doesn't match up to what Strasbourg is). I've been a season ticket holder at La Meinau for 6 seasons now, and I don't miss (almost) a single match.</p>

            <p>As an Alsace native, I quickly became a fervent supporter of Racing Club de Strasbourg. A historic club, the best club in the east (in my humble opinion as a supporter), I quickly became a fan of this club capable of the best and the worst, experiencing great joys during great matches, but also great disappointments (like this season with an average team that does not correspond to what Strasbourg is). I've been a season ticket holder at La Meinau for 6 seasons now, and I don't miss (almost) a single match.</p>

            <p>As a huge football fan, I follow all the leagues, watch lots of matches and summaries and know all the players. But there is one style of player that I adore, the elegant ones. Players like Zidane, Özil or even my favourite, Javier Pastore. Football is an art, it's beautiful when it's played well. I'm a fervent supporter of 'champagne football' and of those players we call magicians. I even went so far as to do my physics and chemistry final on the trajectory of a legendary free-kick taken by one of Brazil's many geniuses: Roberto Carlos.</p>
